DarkRP custom food
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains your custom food.
This file should also contain food from DarkRP that you edited.

THIS WILL ONLY LOAD IF HUNGERMOD IS ENABLED IN darkrp_config/disabled_defaults.lua.
IT IS DISABLED BY DEFAULT.

Note: If you want to edit a default DarkRP food, first disable it in darkrp_config/disabled_defaults.lua
    Once you've done that, copy and paste the food item to this file and edit it.

The default food can be found here:
https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP/blob/master/gamemode/modules/hungermod/sh_init.lua#L33
